# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Introduction
---

This repo contains all the codes I have worked on during my Udacity Nanodegree about self-driving car. This nanodegree is composed of two terms of 3 months. More details about this nanodegree can be found [here](http://www.udacity.com/drive). 

Roughly, the first term focuses more on computer vision aspects of self-driving car (such as finding a line), the use of deep learning (for traffic sign detection and autonomous driving) as well as on sensor fusion with a Kalman Filter. The second term deals with localisation with a particler filter, on path planning and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. 

At the end of these two terms, we get the opportunity to use Carla, the Udacity self-driving car, and the Robot Operating System that controls her. We work with a team of other Nanodegree students to combine what weâ€™ve learned over the course of the entire Nanodegree Program to drive Carla, a real self-driving car, around the Udacity test track!
